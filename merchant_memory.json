But since I can see the struggle in your eyes, how about this? If you manage to find another interested buyer for one of my other swords, I might just let it go for a discounted price of... oh, say 40 gold coins! Now isn't that a deal worth considering? Just remember, once you walk out of here with this beauty in your hands, there'll be no turning back. The path of the swordswoman or -man is a dangerous one, but it's always rewarding. Good luck on your quest, and may your blade never fail you!"

Of course, you'll need to part with quite a pretty penny for it, but then again, it's not every day one gets to wield a blade that could probably cut through butter and steel alike!\n\nBut don't just take my word for it, come give it a feel, if you dare.
